The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

      "description": "By definition an India Pale Ale is known for hops. 70 IBUs and an assertive array of American hops lay blankets of grapefruit, orange nectar, and sticky mango across your senses. This assortment will be certain to remain in your flavor memory. The background malt is reminiscent of graham cracker and faint caramel which adds subtle sweetness and toasted notes. An unabashed dosing of “dry-hops” gives way to abundant aroma and bright citrus flavor. Enjoy it in the company of good friends with barbecued chicken and mango-habanero salsa.",
