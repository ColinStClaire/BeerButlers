        <h3> Define Beer</h3>
        <p>    Q: What exactly is beer?</p>
        <p>    A: Beer is a fermented alcoholic drink made by fermenting cereal grains such as barley, wheat and oats. The yeast added in beer eat the sugars in these grains and then the yeast expels alcohol as a by-product (although a much desired by-product). After a period of time the yeast become saturated in alcohol and start to die off. When it reaches this point, the beer is then fermented. The main ingredients in beer are water, barley, hops and yeast.

        <p>    Q: Is beer a spoiled beverage? Is beer fermented? Does beer have to be fermented?
        </p><p>    A: Beer is a fermented beverage. It isn't spoiled. Fermentation is a chemical processes where sugars are converted into carbon dioxide and alcohol. Fermentation works in an anaerobic environment where there's no air but carbohydrates such as sugar. In order for beer to contain alcohol it must be fermented. There are processes that can remove alcohol after fermentation but it must first be fermented in order for it to be beer regardless if it contains alcohol or not.
